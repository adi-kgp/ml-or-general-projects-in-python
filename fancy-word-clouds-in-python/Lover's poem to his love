I love you Mary!
Even though I am so hairy,
My heart is not so scary!

Nowadays I cannot focus,
because thoughts of you drive me hocus pocus!

The moment I met you online,
Your picture got downloaded in my brain permanently offline!

I know we are so far away,
But hey! we chat our hearts out everyday!

I think God wanted to see how we met
Otherwise why would he create internet?

I am so thankful to God, and to your online presence,
I want to hold and kiss you, that is my prayer in essence!

No one understands what I am going through,
There is only one angel who understands me, and that is you!

Your belief in God and his presence in my life is unmatched,
Even birds begin to doubt their love towards their eggs when they hatch!

That day is never far when I will make you proud,
After all, you are the one who gave me this angelic crowd!

With this crowd you will see me becoming able,
of coming close to you by making everyone believe in aesop's fable!

With this poem, I intent to give you a sweet symphony,
Get job, work hard, come to America, marry her, isn't this a beautiful irony?!
